          <p class="review-text">"After a nightmare experience with another contractor, I was nervous, but Fayetteville Concrete Professionals restored my faith. From day one, they were responsive, transparent, and actually listened to what I wanted. Their team poured a new driveway and even fixed some issues the last company left behind. You can tell they take pride in their work — the finish is smooth, clean, and built to last. Out of all the concrete companies in Fayetteville, this is the one I'd recommend in a heartbeat."</p>

From the first phone call, their team was professional, down-to-earth, and clearly knew their craft. They showed up on time, answered every question I had, and delivered results that totally exceeded our expectations. 10/10 would recommend."</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions About Concrete in Fayetteville</h2>
      
      <div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">How much does a concrete driveway cost in Fayetteville, NC?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Concrete driveway costs in Fayetteville range from $8-$18 per square foot. A standard 400 sq ft driveway costs $3,200-$7,200. Stamped concrete adds 40-60% to the cost. Factors include thickness (4" standard, 5-6" for heavy vehicles), finish type, and site prep requirements.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">What is stamped concrete vs regular concrete?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Stamped concrete has decorative patterns pressed into the surface to mimic brick, stone, slate, or wood. Regular concrete has a smooth or broom finish. Stamped costs $12-$25/sq ft vs $8-$15/sq ft for regular. Both have similar 25-30 year lifespans when properly installed with reinforcement.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">How thick should a concrete driveway be?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Residential driveways should be 4 inches thick minimum. For heavier vehicles (trucks, RVs), we recommend 5-6 inches. Commercial driveways need 6-8 inches. All driveways should use 4,000 PSI concrete and rebar or wire mesh reinforcement for optimal strength.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">How long does concrete take to cure?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Concrete reaches 70% strength in 7 days and full strength in 28 days. Walk on new concrete after 24-48 hours. Wait 7 days before driving on a new driveway. Avoid heavy vehicles for 28 days. Proper curing (keeping moist) during the first week is critical.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">When is the best time to pour concrete in Fayetteville?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Spring (March-May) and fall (September-November) are ideal when temperatures are 50-75°F. Summer pours require early morning starts and rapid curing precautions. Winter pours are possible above 40°F with blankets. North Carolina's mild climate allows year-round work with proper planning.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">Do I need a permit for concrete work in Fayetteville?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Most concrete work requires a permit from the <a href="https://www.fayettevillenc.gov/city-services/development-services/permitting-inspections" target="_blank" rel="noopener">City of Fayetteville Permitting Department</a>. This includes driveways, foundations, and slabs over 120 sq ft. We handle all permitting for our customers at no extra charge.</p>

        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">How long does a concrete driveway last in North Carolina?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">A properly installed concrete driveway lasts 25-30 years on average in North Carolina. With sealing every 2-3 years, some last 50+ years. NC's mild climate (fewer freeze-thaw cycles than northern states) is ideal for concrete longevity. Quality installation is the #1 factor.</p>
        </details>
        
        <details style="background: white; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
          <summary style="font-weight: 600; cursor: pointer; color: #1e3a5f;">What causes concrete to crack?</summary>
          <p style="margin-top: 15px; color: #4b5563;">Concrete cracks from: shrinkage during curing, settling of improperly compacted base, heavy loads, tree roots, and temperature changes. Prevention includes: control joints every 8-10 feet, proper base compaction, adequate thickness, rebar reinforcement, and correct water-cement ratio. Hairline cracks under 1/8" are normal.</p>
